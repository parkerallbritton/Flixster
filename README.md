## Flixster Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Just like with last week's project, the emulation of a virtual android device is unreliable at best and crashes/fails to load ot begin with on my current computer. Following the guide for using my personal Android device instead to run the app and make a video walkthrough on it proved just as innefective. I am constantly working to resolve this issue, but I have yet to emulate the app.
I was able to succesfully boot the virtual device a single time. However, the Flix app was not loaded onto the device. Attempting to restart the virtual device merely put me back at square one: unable to boot the virtual Pixel phone.
